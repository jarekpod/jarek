            	<h2>Wham! - Last Christmas</h2>
				<p>Last Christmas 
				<br>
				I gave you my heart 
				But the very next day 
				You gave it away 
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special 
				<br>
				Last Christmas 
				I gave you my heart 
				But the very next day 
				You gave it away (you gave it away)
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special (special)
				<br>
				Once bitten and twice shy 
				I keep my distance 
				But you still catch my eye 
				Tell me baby 
				Do you recognize me? 
				Well 
				It's been a year 
				It doesn't surprise me 
				<br>
				I wrapped it up and sent it
				With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
				Now, I know what a fool I've been
				But if you kissed me now
				<br>
				I know you'd fool me again
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				But the very next day you gave it away
				<br>
				This year, to save me from tears
				I'll give it to someone special
				(Merry Christmas) 
				<br>
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				But the very next day you gave it away
				This year, to save me from tears
				I'll give it to someone special
				<br>
				A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
				I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
				My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
				Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
				<br>
				A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
				A man under cover but you tore me apart
				Now, I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				<br>
				But the very next day you gave it away
				This year, to save me from tears
				I'll give it to someone special
