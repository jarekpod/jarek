				<p>Last Christmas 
				<br>
				I gave you my heart 
				But the very next day 
				You gave it away 
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special 
				<br>
				Last Christmas 
				I gave you my heart 
				But the very next day 
				You gave it away (you gave it away)
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special (special)
				<br>
				Once bitten and twice shy 
				I keep my distance 
				But you still catch my eye 
				Tell me baby 
				Do you recognize me? 
				Well 
				It's been a year 
				It doesn't surprise me 
				<br>
				I wrapped it up and sent it
				With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
				Now, I know what a fool I've been
				But if you kissed me now
				<br>
				I know you'd fool me again
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				But the very next day you gave it away
				<br>
				This year, to save me from tears
				I'll give it to someone special
				(Merry Christmas)
